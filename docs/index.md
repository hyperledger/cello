![Typical Scenario](imgs/scenario.png)

Hyperledger Cello (HLC) is a blockchain provision and operation system, which helps people use and manage blockchains in a more efficient way.

Based on advanced blockchain technologies and modern PaaS tools, Cello provides the following major features:

* Manage the lifecycle of blockchain networks, e.g., `create/start/stop/delete/keep health` automatically.
* Support customized blockchain network config, e.g., network size, consensus type.
* Support multiple underly infrastructure including bare-metal, virtual machine, vSphere, native [Docker](https://www.docker.com) host, swarm and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). More supports on the way.
* Extends with advanced features like monitoring, logging, health and analytics capability by integrating with existing tools like [ElasticStack](https://www.elastic.co).

Using Cello, blockchain developers can:

* Build up a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform quickly from scratch.
* Provision customizable Blockchains instantly, e.g., a Hyperledger fabric v1.x network.
* Check the system status and manage chains, upload smart contract and test... through dashboards.
* Maintain a pool of running blockchain networks on top of bare-metals, virtual clouds (e.g., virtual machines, vsphere Clouds), container clusters (e.g., Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes).
